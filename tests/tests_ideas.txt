List of all the things we are eager to test, to verify or to have:
All these checks will be done on subnets. By induction process, we therefore know that the final subnet will be stable
The final goal is to succeed to explain to a user building his network where is his mistake.
All the tests will classified in different sections:

1)In construction, low level checks

    TODO:
    -Check if all the python object are well created (detail all the part tested)

    TODO:
    -Check for connexion that the datasink is corresponding
        Send the 2 nodes that are not connecting well

    TODO:
    -Define and check how to sockets can

2)After construction, high level checks

    TODO:
    -Check if the subnet is empty

    TODO:
    -Check if there is no subnet
        with isInstance: otherwise send the name of the subnet to search the mistake

    TODO:
    -Check if there is at least an input

    TODO:
    -Check if the subnet is connexe:
        Send the last node encountered coming from the begining.

    TODO:
     -Check is there is at least an output

     TODO:
     -Check if the copy of subnet is well realized
