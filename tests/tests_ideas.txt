List of all the things we are eager to test, to verify or to have:
All these checks will be done on subnets. By induction process, we therefore know that the final subnet will be stable
The final goal is to succeed to explain to a user building his network where is his mistake.
All the tests will classified in different sections:

1)In construction, low level checks

    TODO:
    -Check if a node_pipe is not connected with himself

    TODO:
    -Check if all the python object are well created (detail all the part tested)

    TODO:
    -Check for connexion that the datasink is corresponding
        Send the 2 nodes that are not connecting well

    TODO:
    -Define and check how to sockets can connect between themself

    TODO:
    -Exception when we really desire an input_socket or output_socket and there is a None

2)After construction, high level checks

    Before Schedule:

    DONE:
    -Check if the subnet is empty

    DONE:
    -Check if there is at least an input

    DONE:
     -Check is there is at least an output

    TODO:
    -Check other thing about the number of nodes and sockets
    if there is a minimum of one node? check the minimum parameters

    TODO:
    -Check if there is no subnet
        Send the name of the subnet to search the mistake

    DONE:
    -Check if before Scheduling every node as an input socket

    During Schedule:

    After Schedule:

    TODO:
    -Find where the maxSize error came from.
    because if every node has not input_socket then we should had been stopped before

    TODO:
    -Check if the subnet is connexe:
        Send the last node encountered coming from the begining.

     TODO:
     -Check if the copy of subnet is well realized
