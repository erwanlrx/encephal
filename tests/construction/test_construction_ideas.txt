List of all the things in the order we are eager to test, to verify or to have during construction of the network
All these checks will be done on subnets. By induction process, we therefore know that the final subnet will be stable
The final goal is to succeed to explain to a user building his network where is his mistake.
All the tests will classified in different sections:

1)In construction, low level checks

    DONE:
    -Check if a node_pipe is not connected with himself

    TODO:
    -Check that we can not connect to Unknown node together

    TODO:
    -Check that the index of the input or output exists

    TODO:
    -Check that a node_pipe has only one input_node_socket and one output_node_socket

    TODO:
    -Check if all the python object are well created (detail all the part tested)
    -For the moment test the add to list for node sockets. Useful?

    TODO:
    -Check for connexion that the datasink is corresponding
        Send the 2 nodes that are not connecting well

    TODO:
    -Define and check how to sockets can connect between themself
    To see if we define multiple input and output for subnet

    TODO:
    -Exception when we really desire an input_socket or output_socket and there is a None

2)After construction, high level checks

    Before Schedule:

        DONE:
        -Check if the subnet is empty

        DONE:
        -Check if there is at least an input

        DONE:
         -Check is there is at least an output

        TODO:
        -Check other thing about the number of nodes and sockets
        if there is a minimum of one node? check the minimum parameters

        TODO:
        -Check if there is no subnet
            Send the name of the subnet to search the mistake

        DONE:
        -Check if before Scheduling every node as an input socket


    During Schedule:



    After Schedule:

        TODO:
        -Find where the maxSize error came from.
        because if every node has not input_socket then we should had been stopped before

        TODO:
        -Check if the subnet is connexe:
            Send the last node encountered coming from the begining.
            Understand the bug we are having

        TODO:
         -Check if the copy of subnet is well realized
